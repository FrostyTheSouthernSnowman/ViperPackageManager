# Viper Package Manager (VPM)
Viper Package Manager aims to bring JavaScript's NPM to Python. **THIS IS NOT AN NPM CLONE!** Viper simply an idea to bring the best of Python, JavaScript, Golang, and others into one easy to use and powerful ecosystem. VPM is the first step to building the Viper ecosystem. Eventually, I will hope to build a Viper language too.
